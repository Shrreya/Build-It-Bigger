# Build It Bigger

A simple app that tells jokes. </br>
Building it bigger with Gradle. </br></br>
Taking the starter code from Udacity and implemented a Java library for supplying jokes, an Android library with an Activity
 that displays jokes and a Google Cloud Endpoints module that supplies jokes from the Java library. Project loads jokes from
 GCE module via an async task. Project contains connected tests to verify that the async task is indeed loading jokes.
 The project contains two flavors, a free flavor with ads and a paid flavor without ads. </br></br>
